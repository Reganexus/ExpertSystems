          (a) Any candidate, political party or coalition of political parties
          contesting the inclusion or exclusion in the canvass of any election
          returns on any of the grounds authorized under Article XX or Sections
          234, 235 and 236 of Article XIX of the Omnibus Election Code shall
          submit their oral objection to the chairman of the board of canvassers
          at the time the questioned return is presented for inclusion in the
          canvass. Such objection shall be recorded in the minutes of the
          canvass.(b) Upon receipts of any such objection, the board of
          canvassers shall automatically defer the canvass of the contested
          returns and shall proceed to canvass the returns which are not
          contested by any party.(c) Simultaneous with the oral objection, the
          objecting party shall also enter his objection in the form for written
          objections to be prescribed by the Commission. Within twenty-four (24)
          hours from and after the presentation of such an objection, the
          objecting party shall submit the evidence in support of the objection,
          which shall be attached to the form for written objections. Within the
          same period of twenty-four (24) hours after presentation of the
          objection, any party may file a written and verified opposition to the
          objection in the form also to be prescribed by the Commission,
          attaching thereto supporting evidence, if any. The board shall not
          entertain any objection or opposition unless reduced to writing in the
          prescribed forms.<br /><br />

          The evidence attached to the objection or opposition, submitted by the
          parties, shall be immediately and formally admitted into the records
          of the board by the chairman affixing his signature at the back of
          each every page thereof.<br /><br />

          (d) Upon receipt of the evidence, the board shall keep up the
          contested returns, consider the written objections thereto and
          opposition, if any, and summarily and immediately rules thereon. The
          board shall enter its ruling on the prescribed form and authenticate
          the same by the signatures of its members.<br /><br />

          (e) Any part adversely affected by the ruling of the board shall
          immediately inform the board if he intends to appeal said ruling. The
          board shall enter said information in the minutes of the canvass, set
          aside the returns and proceed to consider the other returns.

          (f) After all the uncontested returns have been canvassed and the
          contested return ruled upon by it, the board shall suspend the
          canvass. Within forty-eight (48) hours, therefrom, any party adversely
          affected by the ruling may file with the board a written and verified
          notice of appeal; and within an unextendible period of five (5) days
          thereafter an appeal may be taken to the Commission.
          <br /><br />
          (g) Immediately upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the board shall
          make an appropriate report to the Commission, elevating therewith the
          complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass, and furnishing
          the parties with copies of the report.
          <br /><br />
          (h) On the basis of the record and evidence elevate to it by the

          before the Commission on the ruling of the board, without the
          accomplished forms and the evidence appended thereto, shall be
          summarily dismissed.
          <br /><br />
          The decision of the Commission shall be executory after the lapse of
          seven (7) days from receipts thereof by the losing party.

          (i) The board of canvassers shall not proclaim any candidate as winner
          unless authorized by the Commission after the latter has ruled on the

          made in violation hereof shall be void ab initio, unless the contested
          returns will not adversely affect the results of the election.

          as to the veracity of the number of votes stated therein and may
          affect the result of the election, upon request of the Presidential or
          Vice-Presidential candidate concerned or his party, Congress shall,
